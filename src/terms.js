            the dating site where you can find your perfect match! 
            We strive to create a safe and enjoyable experience for 
            all our users. Please read the following terms and 
            conditions carefully before using our services. By accessing 
            or using LYNK, you agree to be bound by these terms and 
            conditions.</p>

          <p><strong>1 Acceptance:</strong> By creating a LYNK account, you agree to be bound 
            by our terms and policies.  If you do not accept and agree to 
            be bound by all the terms of this Agreement, you should not 
            access or use the Service.</p>

          <p><strong>2 Eligibility</strong> Our dating site, LYNK, is intended for use 
            by adults who are 18 years of age or older. By using our 
            services, you represent and warrant that you are at least

            have a profile. You agree to provide accurate, current, and 
            complete information, and to update your profile promptly 
            if any information changes. You are solely responsible for 
            maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials 
            and for any activity that occurs under your account.</p>

          <p><strong>4 User Content:</strong>  When you use LYNK, you may submit or publish 
            content, such as text, photos, and videos, that other users 
            can view. By submitting content, you grant LYNK a non-exclusive, 
            royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, and irrevocable license to 
            use, display, and distribute the content in any form or media. 
            You also represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights 
            to grant us this license and that the content does not infringe 
            any third-party rights or violate any applicable laws or 
            regulations and is considerate other users in the community.</p>

          <p><strong>5 Prohibited Content:</strong>  You agree that you will not post or publish 
            any content on LYNK that is illegal, obscene, defamatory, 
            discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable. You also agree 
            not to use our services to harass, abuse, or harm other users, 
            or to engage in any activity that violates applicable local 
            community guidelines or laws. We reserve the right to remove 
            any content that we deem inappropriate or offensive, and to

            use only. You may not use our services to promote or advertise

            purpose. You agree to use LYNK in compliance with all applicable 
            laws and regulations.</p>

          <p><strong>7 Safety:</strong>  We take the safety of our users very seriously and 
            strive to create a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. 
            However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, 
            or authenticity of user profiles, and we recommend that you 
            take appropriate precautions when communicating with other 
            users. We strongly advise that you do not disclose personal 
            information, such as your full name, address, or phone number, 
            or other sensitive details about yourself to anyone you meet on 
            LYNK. You are solely responsible for any interactions you have 
            with other users, both online and offline. To further help with 
            minimising this risk, we outsource our user verification process 
            to a reputable 3rd party service.</p>

          <p><strong>8 Purchases:</strong> Generally. From time to time, LYNK may offer products 
            and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through the App
            Store, Google Play Store, LYNK direct billing or other payment 
            platforms authorized by LYNK. If you choose to make an in app 
            purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the 
            applicable payment provider, and your method of payment 
            (be it your card or a third party account such as Google Play 
            Store or the App Store) (your “Payment Method”) will be charged 
            for the in app purchase at the prices displayed to you for the 
            service(s) you’ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes 
            that may be imposed on your payments, and you authorize LYNK or 
            the third party account, as applicable, to charge you.</p> 

          <p><strong>9 Auto-Renewal.</strong>  If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic 
            subscription through an in-app purchase, your Payment Method 
            will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel. 
            After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after 
            any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will 
            automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, 
            at the price you agreed to when subscribing. Your card payment 
            information will be stored and subsequently used for the automatic 
            card payments in accordance with the Agreement.</p> 

          <p>If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or 
            if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will 
            need to log in to your third party account (or Settings on LYNK) 
            and follow the instructions to terminate or cancel your 
            subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with 
            us or if you have deleted the LYNK application from your device. 
            If you terminate or cancel your subscription, you may use your 
            subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, 
            and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current 
            term expires. </p>

          <p>You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting LYNK and 
            going to Settings. If a payment is not successfully settled, due 
            to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not 
            edit your Payment Method information, terminate or cancel your 
            subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts 
            and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it 
            may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment 
            billing dates. In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated 
            or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit 
            or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. 
            The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method 
            and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial 
            institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen 
            Payment Method. </p>

          <p><strong>10 Refunds.</strong> Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, 
            and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. 
            We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering 
            is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if 
            the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.</p>

          <p><strong>11 Pricing</strong>  LYNK operates a robust business process, and our pricing 
            varies by several factors.</p> 

          <p> <strong>12 Termination:</strong> We reserve the right to terminate your account or 
            restrict your access to LYNK at any time, without notice or 
            liability, for any reason, including if we believe that you have 
            violated these terms and conditions. You may also terminate your 
            account at any time within the application under settings.</p>

            available" basis, without any warranties of any kind, express or 
            implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, 
            fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or

            direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages 
            arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use 
            LYNK, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such 
            damages. Our total liability to you for any claim arising out 
            of or in connection with these terms and conditions shall not 
            exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for accessing that service 
            for that month.</p>

          <p><strong>15 Indemnification:</strong> You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold 
            harmless LYNK, its affiliates, and their respective directors, 
            officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, 
            liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses,
             or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out 
             of or in connection with your use of LYNK.</p>

          <p> <strong>16 Governing Law:</strong> These terms and conditions shall be governed by 
            and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in 
            which LYNK is operated, primarily in the Federal Republic of 
            Nigeria, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of 
            law.</p>

          <p><strong>17 Modification:</strong> We reserve the right to modify these terms and 
            conditions at any time, without notice or liability, by posting 
            the revised version on LYNK. Your continued use of LYNK after 
            any such modifications shall constitute your acceptance of the 
            modified terms and conditions.</p>

            platform.</p>
